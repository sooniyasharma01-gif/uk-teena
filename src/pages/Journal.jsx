    excerpt: "There's something about a beautifully set table, soft lighting, and a menu you actually want to explore together. My favourite restaurants aren't always the most famous — they're the ones where the evening slows down and conversation takes over.",

    title: "A Weekend in Paris",
    excerpt: "Paris in early spring is something else entirely. The light is different — softer, more golden. I spent a weekend wandering Marais, eating croissants I didn't need, and remembering why slow travel is always the best kind.",

    title: "On Genuine Connection",
    excerpt: "People often ask what makes a great date. My honest answer is simple: presence. Not the restaurant, not the outfit, not the occasion — just two people who are actually there, actually listening, actually curious about each other.",

    excerpt: "I've always loved theatre — the way a story can hold an entire room in silence. Saw a stunning production in the West End recently. There's something about sharing that kind of experience with someone that makes it twice as memorable.",
